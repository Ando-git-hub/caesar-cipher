## Caesar cipher

This project is encodes input text by "Caesar cipher" or decodes already encoded text.

### For run

#### **Run encode `node cipher.js arg1 arg2`**
#### **Run decode `node decoder.js arg1 arg2`**

Where `arg1` is required key for cipher algorithm , `arg2` is input text

```
NOTE: 
  'arg1' is required and must be positive intger. 
  'arg2' is not required. You can pass input text as 'arg2' or you can write text in './input.txt' file.
```

Final result will be written in `'./output.txt'` file.
